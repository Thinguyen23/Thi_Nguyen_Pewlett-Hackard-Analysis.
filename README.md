# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
In this analysis, I help Bobby, an HR analyst from Pewlett Hackard (PH) analyze employment data from PH with the purpose of solving the complexities of retirement at PH.

Using Postgres SQL, I was able to extract data from the 6 database given and create new tables that fit the criteria.

The first step in my analysis is mapping the relationships between tables (including primary keys and foreign keys) in the database using Quick Database Diagrams.

My next step is creating queries to create tables and import data from csv files. The queries for this step is saved as
